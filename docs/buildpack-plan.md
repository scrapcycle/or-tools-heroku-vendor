# OR-Tools Heroku Buildpack Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a Heroku buildpack that automatically installs and configures OR-Tools for Ruby applications using the or-tools-ruby gem.

## Phase 1: Research and Planning

### 1.1 Requirements Analysis
- [ ] Document all dependencies required by or-tools-ruby gem
- [ ] Analyze current build process and artifact structure
- [ ] Identify potential buildpack hooks and lifecycle points
- [ ] Review Heroku buildpack best practices

### 1.2 Architecture Design
- [ ] Design buildpack directory structure
- [ ] Define buildpack interface (detect, compile, release)
- [ ] Plan artifact management strategy
- [ ] Design version management system

## Phase 2: Core Development

### 2.1 Basic Buildpack Structure
- [ ] Create initial buildpack repository
- [ ] Implement basic detect script
- [ ] Implement basic compile script
- [ ] Implement basic release script
- [ ] Add helper functions and utilities

### 2.2 Artifact Management
- [ ] Design artifact packaging system
- [ ] Create artifact versioning scheme
- [ ] Implement artifact download/verification
- [ ] Add artifact caching mechanism

### 2.3 Integration with or-tools-ruby
- [ ] Implement bundler configuration
- [ ] Add environment variable setup
- [ ] Create gem detection logic
- [ ] Add version compatibility checks

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation

### 3.1 Local Testing
- [ ] Create test Rails application
- [ ] Develop test cases for different scenarios
- [ ] Implement local buildpack testing
- [ ] Add debugging tools and logging

### 3.2 Heroku Testing
- [ ] Set up test Heroku applications
- [ ] Test different deployment scenarios
- [ ] Validate buildpack behavior
- [ ] Test with different OR-Tools versions

### 3.3 Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure build time impact
- [ ] Test slug size implications
- [ ] Evaluate cache effectiveness
- [ ] Profile memory usage

## Phase 4: Documentation and Release

### 4.1 Documentation
- [ ] Write buildpack usage guide
- [ ] Document configuration options
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add examples and best practices

### 4.2 Release Preparation
- [ ] Create version tagging system
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Create migration guide from manual setup

## Phase 5: Maintenance and Support

### 5.1 Monitoring and Updates
- [ ] Set up issue tracking
- [ ] Create update schedule
- [ ] Plan for OR-Tools version updates
- [ ] Monitor buildpack usage

### 5.2 Community Support
- [ ] Create contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up support channels
- [ ] Document contribution process
- [ ] Plan for community feedback

## Technical Considerations

### Buildpack Structure
```
or-tools-buildpack/
├── bin/
│   ├── compile    # Main buildpack script
│   ├── detect     # Detects if buildpack should be used
│   └── release    # Sets up runtime environment
├── lib/           # Helper scripts
│   └── or_tools.sh
├── vendor/        # Pre-built OR-Tools artifacts
│   └── or-tools/
└── test/          # Test suite
    └── ...
```

### Key Features
- Automatic detection of or-tools gem
- Pre-built artifact management
- Version compatibility checking
- Caching for faster deployments
- Environment configuration
- Error handling and logging

### Dependencies
- Heroku buildpack API
- or-tools-ruby gem
- Pre-built OR-Tools artifacts
- System libraries (as documented in main README)

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Features
- Multiple OR-Tools version support
- Custom build options
- Advanced caching strategies
- Buildpack composition with other buildpacks
- Automated testing suite
- Performance optimization

### Integration Possibilities
- Integration with other optimization libraries
- Support for other Ruby gems
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Cloud provider extensions

## Success Criteria

1. Buildpack successfully detects or-tools gem
2. Artifacts are correctly installed and configured
3. Applications deploy successfully to Heroku
4. Build time is comparable to manual setup
5. Documentation is clear and comprehensive
6. Community feedback is positive
7. Maintenance burden is manageable

## Timeline

### Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Requirements analysis and architecture design

### Phase 2: 4-6 weeks
- Core development and integration

### Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Testing and validation

### Phase 4: 2-3 weeks
